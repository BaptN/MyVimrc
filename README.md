BaptN - .vimrc file
=======

Simple repository used to share .vimrc between several dev. environments.i

Initially based on great work by Grigio at https://github.com/grigio/vim-sublime with some minor improvements (mainly cleanup of undesired bundles/shortcuts).

Feel free to clone, use, share ... It's a github repository on purpose ;)
